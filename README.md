## How it works
Register to get access. Once your'e in, the main page is going to display a list of the URLs you have. Since this is your first visit, You don't have any! Let's change that!
Click the link "Create a new URL" link. 

## Create a New URL
Got a crazy long URL? Awesome! Type it in (or copy and paste it, I'm not gonna type out all that stuff...) and click the button. 

This will automatically bring you to a new page displaying the short link. Feel free to redirect yourself to your page just by clicking on the Short URL. It will open in a new tab, ready to go!

OOoops, what's that?! I typed in the WRONG long address!! Stop panicing! You are able to edit your original link, no worries!

## Deleting unnessecary Links
On our main page, you now have a bunch of links. Upon reexamining this list, you've decided that some are completely unnessecary. No problem! Just click the delete button and forget all about it. Please be careful though, clicking delete will get rid of it FOREVER. If you want it back, you will have to recreate it. 


## This is Tiny App! 
Thank you for getting Tiny with us!
